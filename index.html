        <h1>What I'm Trying With Git</h1>
        <p>Trying to make the first commit work</p>
        <p>yay! with the help of stack overflow and google (thank god for google) you got the local and remote repositories to work and sync. Let's commit this p too just to make sure it's working ... then we will try and branch</p>
        <p>yup they're working! Reminder ... no commits will show up until you push changes. You can push the changes to your master or to the branch you are working on. Now let's create a new branch and add stuff to it and then eventually merge it with master</p>
        <p>creating new branch</p>
        <p>Woohoo! you just made your first branch and you pushed to it! I'm going commit this to that branch just for the heck of it.</p>
        <p>going to merge firstbranch with master now</p>
        <p>nice! you merged firstbranch and master together! now lets try and make a branch of a branch and merge the second branch to master!</p>
        <p>you are now on a branch of the firstbranc. Let's commit.</p>
        <p>testing out -am thing with commit</p>
        <p>now let's merge onefirstbranch to master and delete firstbranch to see how that works. You can delete a branch locally using -d and remotely using -dr ... i supposed the former is if you want to keep working locally but don't want to send it up to the remote host yet. For now, lets just delete locally and then push the change.</p>

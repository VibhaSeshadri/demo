        <p>Trying to make the first commit work</p>
        <p>yay! with the help of stack overflow and google (thank god for google) you got the local and remote repositories to work and sync. Let's commit this p too just to make sure it's working ... then we will try and branch</p>
        <p>yup they're working! Reminder ... no commits will show up until you push changes. You can push the changes to your master or to the branch you are working on. Now let's create a new branch and add stuff to it and then eventually merge it with master</p>
